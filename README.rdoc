== Greyscale Me
 greyscale_me takes a string of text inputed from the command line
 and creates a greyscale sort of barcode, to achieve this each of 
 your letters are transformed in to a color thanks to the use of 
 python's built in chr() and ord() functions.

== Usage
 $ ./greyscale_me.py 'this is my example' barcode.png
